# uploaded.net-downloader
This is a very simple Linux Script for downloading files from the One-Click-Hoster "Uploaded.net"

First what to do:
Download the script via GitHub or Copy and Paste it in a new file.
1. Do this command: chmod 777 uploaded
to get all permissions.

2. Then replace the placeholder <your id> and <your password>.

3. Create a file called "dl.txt" and put your links in it!

4. Now execute the script with "./uploaded" and go on!

In the feature i will change something! This should work for premium accounts. Free are not tested!
Note: Before you execute the script make sure that direct downloads are enabled in your account settings!
